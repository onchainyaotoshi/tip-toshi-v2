# Tip Toshi v2

## Overview
"Tip Toshi v2" is an enhanced tipping feature on Warpcast, allowing users to send $TOSHI directly to others without the need for a smart account wallet. This streamlined version improves upon the original "[Tip Toshi v1](https://github.com/onchainyaotoshi/tip-toshi)" by simplifying the process and enhancing user experience.

This direct method not only simplifies the user experience but also reduces transaction time and potential errors associated with managing multiple wallet addresses.

## How to Use Tip Toshi v2

2. **Send Tip:** Directly transfer $TOSHI from your verified address to the recipient’s verified address.
